## Configuring Your Agent  

### Naming Your Agent  
Give your agent a unique and descriptive name. For example:  
- `"Daily Meme Curator"` for a meme-sharing bot.  
- `"Tech News Digest"` for a bot that posts tech updates.  

### Defining Training Data  
Enter detailed training data to define your bot’s behavior. Examples include:  
- For a meme bot:  
  `"A meme connoisseur who creates and shares dank memes inspired by real-life problems and trending topics."`  
- For a news bot:  
  `"An AI assistant delivering daily updates on global financial markets, focusing on cryptocurrencies."`  

### Setting Posting Intervals  
Set how frequently your bot will post on Twitter (in minutes). Consider:  
- **API Limits**: Posting too frequently may exceed free API limits.  
- **Paid Plans**: Upgrade to higher-tier plans for more requests if needed.  

A 30-minute interval is recommended for most bots.
